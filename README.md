### Hi there, I'm Deborah 👋

I am a Berlin-based conceptual and strategic thinker creating meaningful digital products from first idea to implementation. I’m currently looking  for a job where I can have a positive impact and continue learning amongst a great team.

- 💻 I've just completed an intense 9-week Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin
- 🏠 I’m working on neighbors, a rails app to connect neighbors next door: https://www.neighbors-app.fun/
- 🎓 I’m starting to learn React & Redux
- 💬 You can ask me about UX Design
- 📫 Shoot me a message on LinkedIn if you like: https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborahsillmann/

Apart from work I’m passionate about cheese 🧀, weight lifting 🏋, learning new things 💻, reading good books and articles 📚 and taking pictures of useless things to feed my instagram. 🤷
