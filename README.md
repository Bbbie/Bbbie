<h1>Hi there, I'm Deborah 👋</h1>

<p>Hey there, I'm Deborah! 👋 I'm a creative technologist from Berlin who designs compelling, user-centric products from initial idea to implementation.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I've worked as a Product and UX designer in interdisciplinary teams where I gained a lot of experience across all phases of product development. While at VW Future Center I focused on early concept development and iterative prototyping and user testing, at LivingPackets I led the UX and UI Design of a mobile app from development to production. Over the years I've gotten more and more interested to code the products I design myself so after joining Le Wagons Web Development program, I'm working as a Junior Frontend Developer at Strichpunkt.</p>

<p>Since my studies, therapeutic products have been by far my favorite subject. 💘</p>

<p>Apart from work I'm into cheese 🧀, weight lifting 🏋🏻‍♀️, learning new things 👩🏻‍💻, reading good books and articles 📚 and taking pictures of useless things to feed my instagram. 🤷🏻‍♀️ </p>
